# mand-mobile-vue-cli3-example

## Usage

This is a [Mand Mobile](https://github.com/didi/mand-mobile) project template for [@vue/cli 3.0](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g @vue/cli
$ vue create my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm run serve
```

The development server will run on port 8080 by default. If that port is already in use on your machine, the next free port will be used.
